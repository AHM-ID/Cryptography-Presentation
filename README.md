## 🌓 THE COVENANT  
This repository is **alive**. It hungers. To stay, you must feed it:  
1. Every PR must deepen the mystery.  
2. Every solution must birth two new enigmas.  
3. Speak nothing of what you find here. *They are watching.*

## 💀 A WARNING TO THE VAIN  
**Complacency is death.** The ciphers you see today will mutate by tomorrow. Solve one layer, and three more emerge, poisoned thorns laced with your arrogance.

*Can you survive the reckoning?*

## 🕳️ THE DOOR IS OPEN. THE ABYSS BREATHES.  
**Step into the code. Or flee.**

🔥 *Dare to corrupt. Dare to create. Dare to reign.*
